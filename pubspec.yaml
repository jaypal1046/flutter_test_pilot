  # This package supports all platforms where Flutter testing is available
  # Integration testing supports: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux
  # Widget/Unit testing supports: All platforms including Web

  # Note: We're not declaring this as a plugin since it's a testing framework
  # that works through Flutter's existing testing infrastructure

  # If you need platform-specific testing utilities in the future,
  # you can add plugin configuration like this:
  # plugin:
  #   platforms:
  #     android:
  #       package: com.example.flutter_test_pilot
  #       pluginClass: FlutterTestPilotPlugin
  #     ios:
  #       pluginClass: FlutterTestPilotPlugin
  #     macos:
  #       pluginClass: FlutterTestPilotPlugin
  #     windows:
  #       pluginClass: FlutterTestPilotPlugin
  #     linux:
  #       pluginClass: FlutterTestPilotPlugin
  #     # Note: Web is excluded as integration_test doesn't support web

# Declare supported platforms explicitly for pub.dev scoring
platforms:

  ios:
