### Added

#### Core Framework

- Initial release of **Flutter Test Pilot**, a robust testing framework for Flutter apps
- `FlutterTestPilot` singleton for streamlined test management
- `TestSuite` for organizing tests with setup, execution, and cleanup phases
- `TestGroup` for grouping related test suites
- `TestPilotRunner` for seamless `testWidgets` integration
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

#### UI Interaction Actions

- **Tap Actions**: `Tap`, `DoubleTap`, `TripleTap`, `LongPress`
- **Text Input**: `Type` class with 17 widget-finding strategies
- **Drag Operations**: `DragDrop` with widget-to-widget and offset-based support
- **Gestures**: `Pan`, `Pinch`, `Scroll`, `Swipe`
- Smart widget disambiguation using context and position

#### API Testing

- `ApiObserverManager` for HTTP request/response interception
- `ApiTestAction` for API validation with `Api` factory (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- `RequestCheck` and `ResponseCheck` for field-level validation
- JSON path navigation for complex API data
- Dio interceptor for automatic API capture

#### Widget Finding

- Key-based (ValueKey, Key, GlobalKey), text, widget type, and semantic label support
- Input decoration (hint, label, helper text) and controller-based finding
- Parent/child traversal and position-based selection

#### Reporting

- `ConsoleReporter` with colored, formatted output
- `JsonReporter` for structured results and JUnit XML for CI/CD
- Execution summaries with performance metrics

#### Validation

- Built-in functions (`exists`, `equals`, `contains`) and custom validation
- Detailed error messages with expected vs. actual comparisons

### Features

#### Error Handling

- Retry mechanisms for flaky UI interactions
- Custom error handlers and gesture boundary checks

#### Performance

- Optimized widget tree traversal and test execution
- Smart waiting for animations and state changes

#### Developer Experience

- Fluent, type-safe API with IDE-friendly intellisense
- Comprehensive documentation and example test suites

#### Test Organization

- Hierarchical structure: Groups > Suites > Steps
- Phase-based execution with metadata and timeout support

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies

- Flutter SDK: `>=3.0.0`
- Dart SDK: `>=2.17.0 <4.0.0`
- Dio: `^5.0.0` (for API testing)

#### Architecture

- Singleton for test management
- Observer pattern for API interception
- Strategy and factory patterns for widget finding and actions

#### Platform Support

- **Full**: iOS, Android
- **Partial**: Web (no native gestures), Desktop (limited gestures)

### Documentation

- README with quick start guide
- API reference and best practices
- Integration guides for popular packages

### Known Limitations

- Limited gesture support on web and desktop
- API testing requires Dio integration
- Some custom widgets may need advanced finding strategies
